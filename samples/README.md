# Sample VP Link simulation models

Use one of the sample simulations to experiment with various brain designs.  You can take advantage of
and experiment with many of the Bonsai features such as:
* using goals
* using lessons and scenarios
* using customized reward functions
* using State Transform functions
* using Action Transform functions

You may also find it instructive to explore the following topics:
* How does adjusting the simulator time step affect the brain teaching performance?
* Can customized reward functions do better than Goal-based rewards?
* How can I use lessons to train a brain incrementally?

Choose one of the following samples

* [Simple Tank](simpletank/README.md) -- a great way to get started with Bonsai
* [Quad Tank](quadtank/README.md) -- a more complicated control problem
* [Enzyme Bug Reactor](bugreactor/README.md) -- simulation based on a real-world problem with deadtime and unmeasurable process variables.

Each of these examples includes a VP Link loadable file that you can download and use to create a scalable simulator in the Bonsai platform.

## For VP Link Users

If you have VP Link installed locally, you can use the .REV files as your GUI to observe and manipulate the model.

On each of the samples, there is a "Bonsai Integration" page, as well as a "Bonsai Tags" page.  You can use the buttons
on these pages to connect the local VP Link server to Bonsai as an unmanaged sim, as well as create your own
loadables.
